# Calendar

The Calendar Module is used to display events from an **iCAL feed**. Calendar events can be filtered using **Interval options** and formatted using text templates. 



Click on the **Calendar Widget** on the toolbar,  add / drag to the target **Region**.  ![Calendar Widget](img/v2_media_calendar_widget.png)

If you are using 1.8, select **Calendar** from the Widget Toolbox to add to your Region Timeline and complete the form fields as explained below. 
{/tip}

### Configuration

![Calendar Configuration](img/v2_media_calendar_configuration.png)



- Provide the iCAL URL.
- Use the Interval option as a filter to show events for a certain period. Use natural language such as '1 day' or '2 weeks' to return the events within your chosen time frame.
- Specify the Number of items / events you wish to display from the iCAL feed.
- Select the **Exclude all day events** tick box if you would like all day events excluded from the feed and therefore not displayed.
- Choose to **Exclude current events** so that they are removed from the feed and therefore will not be displayed.
- Opt to use the **event timezone** and **calendar timezone**. Left unticked, the timezone set in the CMS will be used.
- If your feed is from **Windows** use the check box.

### Appearance

- Use **Date Format** to ensure that you show the appropriate date/time formats for your calendar events.  

- Use the checkbox to show calendar items side by side.

- Select an effect using the drop-down menu to be used to transition between items.

- With an **Effect** selected specify the number of **events** you wish to show per page.

  {tip}
  We would encourage users to opt for an effect when you have several events you wish to display, otherwise they will be shown as static lists.

Include text merge fields from the **Snippets** menu to pull in the required event information from the Calendar. Click on the **Save** button.



{tip}
From v2.1.0, [Date] tags can include an optional format [Date|format] so that [Date] can be used multiple times in a Template with different formats which allows for different styling for each element of the date.

{/tip}

{tip}
If you are using 1.8 text merge fields are located under the **Available Substitutions**.
{/tip}

#### Current Event

Using the **Set an alternative template for events that are current** feature will tell [[PRODUCTNAME]] to use the Players date/time to work out if the event showing is current. 

![Calendar Current Event](img/v2_media_calendar_current_events.png)

Include alternative text and formatting to be used just for your **Current Events**. 

Include **Snippets** to pull the required information from your calendar.

#### No Data

Include a message to ensure that your audience is not left with blank displays when no information is returned from the iCAL feed.

### Optional Style Sheet

Include CSS to apply to the template structure.

### Caching

Include a suitable time for the Update Interval in minutes, keeping it as high as possible. This determines how often the Module will request data from your feed. If your calendar only ever modified with events scheduled days in advance, you can set this for a long period.

{tip}
It is best practice to contact a remote feed as little as possible.
