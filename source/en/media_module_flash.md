# Flash

Upload SWF files to use in Playlists and Layouts.

{feat}Adobe Flash|v3{/feat}

{version}
**IMPORTANT:** As Adobe no longer supports Flash, it will be naturally phased out over a period of time.  With the discontinued development and support for this application the Flash Module is no longer supported on Android. After extensive testing, it was found that instabilities in the Player could cause the Player to close. Should you still choose to run via the Flash Module or on embedded websites, it will render using the Flash application if available. However, if you have stability problems with your device this may be due to the running of Flash content.

Whilst Players may still play flash at this current time, updates to operating systems and other third party components, such as the browser, may render Flash files as unplayable.

## Overview

- View existing and upload new SWF files directly to Playlists/Layouts using the [Library other media Search](layouts_library_search.html) from the toolbar.
- Files uploaded directly to Playlists and Layouts are automatically saved to the [Library](media_library.html) for re-use.
- Set [start and end times](layouts_library_search#content-expiry-dates) for SWF files uploaded directly to a Playlist/Layout.
- Save SWF files to [Folders](tour_folders.html#content-saving-to-folders) on upload, to easily control access to Users.
