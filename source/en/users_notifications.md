# Notifications

[[PRODUCTNAME]] has a **Notification System** to keep Administrators and Users of the CMS informed of important system events and other user-created notifications, such as [Schedule Event Reminders](scheduling_events#Reminders.png).

{tip}
Please ensure that your Administrator has entered a **Sending Email** address on the CMS Settings page, **Network** tab prior to using Notifications.

If you are using v1.8 of the CMS,  you can find these settings on the **Maintenance** tab.

## Notification Drawer

Notifications for a logged in User appear at the top right of the screen with unread notifications shown in red next to the Alarm bell icon. The Notification Drawer can be accessed by clicking on the Alarm bell icon.

{tip}
The Notification Drawer is shown when a User or User Group has the **Notification Drawer** permission, without this permission the Alarm bell icon will not be shown.
{/tip}

Click on the Alarm bell to open the Notification Drawer, which will show the last 5 notifications received. Unread notifications will be shown in black text and read notifications in a light grey text.

## Notification Centre

Notifications can be created by authorised Users, those that have permission, by using the **Notification Centre** link at the bottom of the Notification Drawer and clicking on the **Add Notification** action button.

{/tip}

### Audience

**Users** - Select one or more Users/User Groups

**Non users** - additional emails can be entered here to receive notifications

**Displays** - Select one or more Display/Display Groups to show the notification within Scheduled Layouts. (Scheduled Layouts must already include the Notification Widget to target Displays successfully).

Attachments can also be downloaded from the Notification centre.

## Editing Notifications

Edits to a Notification will be altered in the CMS web portal but any emails generated which have already been sent will not be recalled.

## System Notifications

[[PRODUCTNAME]] raises various **System Notifications** to report on the health of the system as a whole. Notifications are emailed to the Admin email address configured in Settings, Maintenance tab. Notifications will also be sent to Users who belong to groups configured to receive System Notifications or who have been configured to receive these notifications themselves. This configuration is managed on the User/User Group Edit form.
