So you can get the best support from us we ask that you provide us with specific information when contacting us with a support request:

- Description of the issue you are experiencing.
- Detailed steps so that the issue can be recreated by our team.
- Download a troubleshoot zip file from the CMS central ‘error log’ and attach to your support ticket.



## CMS error log

The CMS collects messages from all the components within the platform; CMS, Players, API, Maintenance etc and so is a valuable resource when investigating issues.

CMS logging can be provided from the **Report Fault** page located under the Advanced section of the Menu. Click on start to be taken through the fault wizard which will guide you through the steps to collect and download a troubleshoot.zip file.
