# DataSet Ticker

The DataSet Ticker Widget allows for **DataSet** content to be displayed as a **Ticker** on a Layout. The Ticker module primarily consists of a data source location and a template to apply to the retrieved data.
{tip}
Ensure that a [DataSet](https://xibo.org.uk/manual/en/media_datasets.html) has been created and configured prior to using this Widget.
