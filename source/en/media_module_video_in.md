- Use the drop-down to select which device input should be shown.

- Choose to override the default duration if necessary.
- Tick to expand the video over existing content and therefore play in full screen.

{tip}
To seamlessly show content alongside **Live TV** create an Overlay Layout with the **Video In** Widget added, this will allow for your layout of content ‘underneath’ to display and rotate freely. This will prevent the TV signal from skipping with each Layout load if on the same Layout.
