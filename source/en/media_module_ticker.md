The Ticker Widget primarily consists of a data source location which feeds into configured **Elements** when using the [Layout Editor](layouts_editor.html) and **Static Templates** which are available in both the [Playlist](media_playlists.html#content-playlist-editor) and Layout Editors.

## Overview

- Complement Elements by adding [Global Elements.](layouts_editor.html#content-global-elements)
- Create [Element Groups](layouts_editor.html#content-grouping-elements) for easier configuration/positioning when adding groups of multiple Elements/Global Elements.
- Handle paging of data with [Data Slots](layouts_editor.html#content-data-slots) for each Element.
- Variety of customisable [Static Templates](layouts_editor.html#content-static-templates).
- Define how many items to display.
- Set transition effects.
- Duration can be set per item.
