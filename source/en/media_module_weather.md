Complete the form fields and include the **API key**. The CMS allows a Cache period to be specified which will create a delay between requests for each geographic location.

Open Weather Map allows 1000 requests for a forecast, per day before charging a small fee for each subsequent request.

{tip}
**Paid plans** unlock a 16 day forecast as well as other optimisations in the way the data is pulled through.

![Weather Templates](img/v2_media_weather_templates.png)

#### Preset

- Tick to edit the selected template. Please see the section on [Editing default templates](media_module_weather.html#editing_default_templates) below for further information.

### Caching

Enter the Update Interval in minutes.



## Attribution

All Layouts that use the Weather Widget need to include attribution, available by using the `[Attribution]` tag. All preset templates contain this tag by default, please ensure that this tag is included when editing/overriding default templates.



## Editing default templates

Default templates can be edited by selecting a template using the drop-down and clicking in the **Override the template** checkbox. 

{tip}
The template will be automatically scaled and should be designed for the intended output resolution. The following guidelines should be considered when editing templates:

- Templates must be designed at a fixed size
- All elements must use absolute sizing in px, including fonts, margins, widths, heights, etc
- If positioning is used, it must be from top,left
- Templates can use bootstrap
- The aspect ratio will be fixed by [[PRODUCTNAME]] and sized to fit the Region
- Templates are treated the same as a static image
  {/tip}

Click again on the **Templates** tab and select to edit:

![Edit Default Templates](img/v2_media_weather_edit_default.png)

### Current forecast template

Also known as the **main template** as it is used for the current weather conditions and as the basis for the repeating Daily forecast template.

{tip}
Click on **Get Forecast** to see available substitutions to use.
{/tip}

{tip}
Toggle **On** the Visual editor to use the Inline Editor to provide text and formatting.
{/tip}

### Daily forecast template

This is the **repeating template** that should be provided for the 7 day forecast. It will be repeated each day and then substituted into the special `[dailyForecast]` tag (which should feature on the main template). 

The `[dailyForecast]` tag has 2 optional settings which can be added to the tag by including the`|` character. These are `[dailyForecast|Number of days|Start day]` and default to 7 days, starting at tomorrow (day 2). If you wanted to see the next 3 days you would use [dailyForecast|3]` and for a 3 day forecast starting the day after tomorrow you could use `[dailyForecast|3|3]`.
{tip}  

 A common example is to ignore the "Current Template" and produce a full 7 day forecast using the daily forecast - this is achieved with `[dailyForecast|7|1]`.

{/tip}

### CSS

This is the CSS to apply to the template structure above. It will be augmented with a colour 
attribute and has a special `[[ICONS]]` which will be replaced with a selected icon sprite. 

### Get Forecast

It is possible to **request a forecast** at any time to see what forecast data is returned. Any field is available as a substitute in the template by entering the field name between square 
brackets - for example `[nearestStormDistance]`.

### Extending with new icons

New icons can be added by an Administrator who has access to the file system. Any PNG file in `modules/theme/forecastio/weather_icons` will be made available for selection in the Icons selector.

Weather icons are provided as a sprite, each icon is 128x128 and should represent the same weather conditions as the shipped icon sprite.
{tip}
For example, a "clear-day" is represented by the icon in position 1, a "windy day" is represented by the icon in position 11.
