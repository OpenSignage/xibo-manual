# Audio 

Add audio files to play on your Layouts and Playlists.

{feat}Audio|v3{/feat}

## Widget Overview

- Upload audio files directly to Playlists/Layouts using the Audio Widget.
- Audio files previously uploaded to the [Library](media_library.html) can be added from the tool bar [Library Search](layouts_library_search.html) functions.
- Uploaded audio files are cached for off-line playback.

- Fully compatible with [Overlay Layouts.](layouts_overlay.html)

- Control the duration of the audio file.


## Configuration

From the properties panel you can see how long the audio will play for.

Tick **Set a duration** to provide a specific duration:

- Set a lower duration to cut the original file duration short.
- Select a higher duration and use the Loop function to start from the beginning to satisfy the longer duration.
