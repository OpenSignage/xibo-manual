# Folders

From v3.0.0 **Folders** can be used throughout the CMS to search, organise and easily control User/User Group [Share](users_features_and_sharing.html) options for items held within a specific Folder.

## Creating Folders

Folders can be created to hold **Library Media**, **DataSets**, **Playlists**, **Layouts**, **Campaigns**, **Templates**, **Displays** and **Display Groups** and are accessed from multiple [Grids](tour_grids.html) by clicking the **Folder** icon to open the Folder Tree:

![Folder Grid](img/v3_tour_folders_grid.png)

- Right click the **Root Folder** to **Create** a new Folder to add to the tree.


-  Right click to access a menu with options to **Create** a sub-folder, **Rename**, **Remove** and **Share**:

{tip}
Only empty folders can be removed! 
{/tip}

Folders can be created, renamed and removed from **Add** and **Edit** [Forms](tour_forms.html) and by using the **Select Folder** option from the **Row Menu** for an object (dependent on [Feature](users_features_and_sharing.html) access).

## Sharing Options

Each folder can have [Share options](users_features_and_sharing.html) set for Users/User Groups by clicking on **Share** from the menu.

{tip}
**Share** options for folders can only be set by Super Administrator users!
{/tip}

- Select from the list of Users and User Groups (User Groups are shown in **bold**) and assign **View**, **Edit** and **Delete** options as required for the selected folder.

Once Share options have been set for a folder, all objects contained or moved to that folder will inherit the View, Edit, Delete options that  have been enabled for Users/User Groups.

{tip} 
New Users can have **Folders** assigned from the start by following the onboarding wizard to [Add Users](users_administration.html)!
{/tip}

## Folder Search

The Folder tree will open by default on a grid and can be toggled off from view by clicking on the folder icon:

![Folder File Path](img/v3_tour_folder_file_path.png)

{tip} 
When folders are hidden from view, the file path for a selected folder will be shown so you always know where you are looking!

With folders open, highlight a folder/sub-folder to search the contents and return results based on any filters that have been applied to the Grid. 

Use the **All Folders** tick box to include searching in the Root Folder!
{/tip}


## Saving to Folders

Items can be saved to folders from **Add**/**Edit** forms and from the Row menu using **Select Folder** to open.

{tip}
If you already have a folder selected, objects added via the Add form will be automatically saved into the selected folder!
{/tip}
