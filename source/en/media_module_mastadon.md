# Mastadon

Display Mastadon social feed content anywhere on a Layout using Elements or include Static Templates with pre-styled designs in Layouts/Playlists.

{feat}mastadon widget|v4{/feat}

The Mastadon Widget returns content from the URL entered for the [Module](media_modules.html) which feeds into configured Elements and Static Templates.

## Mastadon Elements

[Elements](https://test.xibo.org.uk/manual/en/layouts_editor#content-data-widgets-and-elements) are available for selection when adding a Mastadon Widget to a [Layout](https://test.xibo.org.uk/manual/en/layouts_editor.html) to give Users more control over what components of the Mastadon Widget to use and where they can be placed.

Each Element has a set of configuration options in the Properties Panel. A **Hashtag** must be provided to return results from the **Configure** tab for each Element used on the Layout. Control how items should be cycled by specifying a [Data Slot](https://test.xibo.org.uk/manual/en/layouts_editor.html#content-data-slots) to use for each of the added Elements. Data Elements can be further complimented by adding [Global Elements](https://test.xibo.org.uk/manual/en/(layouts_editor.html#content-global-elements)) to add shapes and text which can all be put into an [Element Group](https://test.xibo.org.uk/manual/en/layouts_editor.html#content-grouping-elements) for easier configuration and positioning.

Take advantage of [Stencils](https://test.xibo.org.uk/manual/en/layouts_editor.html#content-stencils) to add a predesigned group of Elements to your Layout.

{tip}
All Elements in the Stencil are treated as ‘one’ when configured and can be easily duplicated from a right click!

## Mastadon Static Templates

[Static Templates](https://test.xibo.org.uk/manual/en/layouts_editor.html#content-static-templates) define how returned items should be laid out and styled and are a simple way to show items using pre-styled templates.

Templates can be configured to affect the behaviour of returned results as well as make changes to the design appearance using a range of options in the Properties Panel. A **Hashtag** must be provided to return results from the **Configure** tab for each Template added to the Layout/Playlist.
