# Users

[[PRODUCTNAME]] allows individual access to the CMS by multiple people with a **Username** and **Password** authentication system.

Users are granted access within the CMS by their **User Type** and applied access options, all pre-configured by an Administrator.

## User Groups

Users can be assigned to one or multiple User Groups who inherit the access granted to that particular group, pre-configured by an Administrator.

## Ownership

All items created in the CMS by an individual User are owned by that User. Ownership of an item (be it a Layout, Media File, or Scheduled Event) gives that User full editing rights including the ability to share with other Users.

## API

Users may also grant API applications access to the CMS using their credentials.
